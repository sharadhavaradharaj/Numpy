## Exercise ##

# 1 Using a list comprehension, create a new list called "newlist" out of the list "numbers", 
# which contains only the positive numbers from the list, as integers.

numbers = [34.6, -203.4, 44.9, 68.3, -12.2, 44.6, 12.7]
newlist = [int(x) for x in numbers if x > 0]
print(newlist)


## 2 create a list of integers which specify the length of each word in
## a sentence except for the word 'the'
sentence = "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
words = sentence.split()
print(words)
print([len(word) for word in sentence.split() if word.lower() != 'the'])



## 3 Given dictionary is consisted of vehicles and their weights in kilograms. 
## Contruct a list of the names of vehicles with weight below 5000 kilograms. 
## In the same list comprehension make the key names all upper case.
dict={"Sedan": 1500, "SUV": 2000, "Pickup": 2500, "Minivan": 1600, "Van": 2400, 
"Semi": 13600, "Bicycle": 7, "Motorcycle": 110}

list1 = [i.upper() for i in dict if dict[i]<5000]
print(list1)
